					<p>A honeypot is a cybersecurity mechanism that uses a manufactured attack target to lure cybercriminals away from legitimate targets. They also gather intelligence about the identity, methods and motivations of adversaries.</p>
					<p>It is intentionally and purposefully designed to look like a legitimate target, resembling the model in terms of structure, components and content.</p>
					<p>The honeypot serves as a decoy, distracting cybercriminals from actual targets. It can also serve as a reconnaissance tool, using their intrusion attempts to assess the adversaryâ€™s techniques, capabilities and sophistication.</p>

					<h2>Production Honeypot</h2>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-unmatched="fade">
					<h2>Production Honeypot</h2>
					<p>Production honeypots are placed inside the production network with other production servers by an organization to improve their overall state of security. Normally, production honeypots are low-interaction honeypots, which are easier to deploy. They give less information about the attacks or attackers than research honeypots.</p>

					<h2>Research Honeypot</h2>

				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-unmatched="fade">
					<h2>Research Honeypot</h2>
					<p>A research honeypot is designed to collect information about the specific methods and techniques used by adversaries and what possible vulnerabilities exist within the system in reference to such tactics. Most research honeypots are high-interaction honeypots.</p>

					<h2>Decoy Database</h2>
					<p>A decoy database is an intentionally vulnerable fictitious data set that helps organizations monitor software vulnerabilities, architecture insecurities or even nefarious internal actors.</p>
					<p>The decoy database will gather information about injection techniques, credential hijacking or privilege abuse used by an attacker that can then be built into system defenses and security policies.</p>
